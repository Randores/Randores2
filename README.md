Randores 2: The rewrite of Randores for MC 1.12+

Randores 1, in my opinion, was quite a success, with 3,000+ downloads! But... it was buggy, slow, hacky, and was missing the most requested feature, customization. Randores 2 is a rewrite of Randores 1.x. It's not hacky, it's not (too) slow, and it's not _that_ buggy... For more information, see [the wiki](https://github.com/Randores/Randores2/wiki).
